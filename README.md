# gulp-config
This is my personal gulp-configuration for development in order to quickly start build and creating a project.

Commands: 

``npm run serve`` - Start Gulp with dev-server and watching

``npm run build`` - Build project with minified files

``npm run deploy`` - Build project and deploy to GitHub Pages
